The Impulse Tracker Font Customizer.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Are you using a text mode tracker?
Do you squint at those tiny numbers?
Do you complain about fat letters?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Well Complain no more!  Now, with ITF,
you can choose (and make!) your own fonts!!



(Relax, ITF wastes absolutely ZERO memory
 space from Impulse Tracker!)



____Using ITF______________________________
Basically its much like ST3 and IT's
controlls...

Arrows   Navigate inside the edit box
Tab      Go Between the Edit Box, the
         Font List Box. (If you're
         really coordinated, you can even 
         directly copy and paste from
         the Font List box! :)
         If the Scroll Lock is also on,
         this will also go between the
         Preview Box.

Shift+Tab Reverse direction of Tab.
         (goes through Preview Box
          even when Scroll Lock is
          off)

Space    Plot if Empty before
         Blank if Plotted before
Del      Blank a line Horizantally
Ins      Fill a line Horizontally

+        Next Character to Edit
         (Also Ctrl+RightArrow)
-        Previous Character
         (Also Ctrl+LeftArrow)
PageDown 4 Characters Ahead
PageUp   4 Characters Before
Home     First editable Character
End      Last editable Character

Shift+Arrow  Shifts a character a
         bit left, right, higher, or
         lower

[        Rotates the character left
         by 90ø
]        Rotates the character right
         by 90ø
{        Fine tuning Rotation to the
         left.
}        Fine tuning Rotation to the
         right.

Alt I    Inverse the current character
         (just try it, you can inverse
          again to get it back :)
Alt C    Copy a Character
Alt P    Paste a Character
Alt Z    Clear the Edit Box

Ctrl R   Reload Character Bank.
         Use the arrow keys here and
         Enter to load up a file to
         see the fonts they hold.  
Ctrl S   Save into a Character Bank.
         User the arrow keys here as
         well.  Press Enter to
         overwrite a file.
         Only saving it as "Font.CFG"
         would Impulse Tracker update
         it's font.

         (Remember, nothing's really
          done until you save!)

Ctrl Q   Go make a Song.

____Using ITF "Lesser Functions"________________

Shift-G  Saves the font into a raw
        graphics file (8x2048).  Just
        Press Shift-G anytime in the
        Control-S saving window...
        it'll always save only into
        "2x2048.Raw"

Control+BackSpace
         You can IGNORE this button.
         It just reloads the old
         standard 8x8 ROM font... but,
         I'm sure you'd prefer the other
         cool fonts.

BackSpace
         You can ignore this one too.
         This only reloads the default
         IT graphics set - so the
         other characters (like A to z)
         are not defaulted.



____Files________________________________________

Everything is reletively easy to
  try out so just run ITF and see for
  yourself.  *Remember!: Impulse Tracker
  strictly uses Font.Cfg.  If you have
  another font you want Impulse Tracker
  to use, rename it to Font.Cfg (after 
  making a backup for the original, of course ;)
The other font files are font set banks..saved
  as "*.ITF"'s.

Special thanks to Jeffrey Lim for some
 vital programming support (testing, info,
 supporting ITF in IT, music to listen to,
 and, basically, everything).

Questions? Comments? Or, :) If you make a
 great new font set (usable OR artistic) 
 please send them to me...I may be able
 to release them in the future for everyone.

And Finally....
 Stop Reading this and GO MAKE THAT
  great  S O N G  for all to Hear ! ! !
  (or the environment to make that song)  ;)


       \ /\ /
     \ //~~\\ /
     Z a S t a R
     / \\__// \
       / \/ \














P.S.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you thing you're REALLY good, you can try out
  the special command line options.  Type "ITF ?"
  to get some info on this.

Option -f loads a 8x16 font file and *tries* really
  hard to squish it into the 8x8 form.
Option -g loads a graphic file (must be RAW).
  It must only have two colors (one being black) for
  obvious reasons.  The actual X resolution of the
  RAW graphics file should be a multiple of 8, since
  each character is only 8 pixels wide.



If you got suggestions for more additional
  functions for whatever need, just tell me.  I'll
  put it in (if my University allows me the time  ;)

Okay, that's all!   Now go make that song !!
