Roland TR-808 sample set


This sample set was originally created by Michael Fischer, who has since
seemed to drop out of sight (last known email address: reliv@netcom.com,
also fischer1@student2.cl.msu.edu).

One version of the sample set, in AIFF format, was kept at the oak.oakland.edu
site, which has shut down, the sample set apparently lost. Another version
of the sample set, in WAV format, was retrieved from ftp.cica.indiana.edu
(or its mirror at archive.orst.edu) and brought to the music machines
web site (http://www.hyperreal.com/machines/) and placed in
http://www.hyperreal.com/machines/manufacturers/Roland/TR-808/samples/

Because the sample set is so large, I've broken it up (without Michael's
permission at this time) into separate files, by 808 instrument. 

These are:
	808-BD.zip	bass drum
	808-CB.zip	cowbell
	808-CH.zip	close hi-hat
	808-CL.zip	claves
	808-CP.zip	clap
	808-CY.zip	cymbal
	808-HC.zip	hi conga
	808-HT.zip	hi tom
	808-LC.zip	lo conga
	808-LT.zip	lo tom
	808-MA.zip	?
	808-MC.zip	mid conga
	808-MT.zip	mid tom
	808-OH.zip	open hi-hat
	808-RS.zip	?
	808-SD.zip	snare drum

The files expand into separate directories with the WAV files in them.

The full file will stick around at least for a while as:
	808-ALL.zip

A copy of the AIFF set would be appreciated. contact me.
