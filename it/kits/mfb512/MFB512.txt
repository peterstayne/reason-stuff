MFB 512 Drum machine sounds
---------------------------

* bassdrum
* snaredrum
* cymbal
* hi tom
* mid tom
* low tom
* hand clap
* hi hat open
* hi hat closed
* 4/4 loop

All sounds were sampled in 44.1 kHz, 16 bits mono
using a Turtle Beach Tropez plus and Sound Forge.

The beatbox itself is a nightmare to use.
How about BINARY user interface via small switches???
